# Cub3D Project

Cub3D is a project—originally developed as part of the 42 school curriculum—that challenges you to create a simple 3D game engine using the raycasting technique. Here’s a brief overview of what the project entails:

## 3D Rendering with Raycasting

- **3D Rendering with Raycasting:**  
  Build a basic engine that takes a 2D map (typically defined in a configuration file) and renders it in 3D. The raycasting algorithm simulates a 3D perspective similar to early 3D games like *Wolfenstein 3D*.

## Configuration File Parsing

- **Configuration File Parsing:**  
  The project involves reading a `.cub` configuration file, which contains:
  - Paths to texture files for different walls.
  - Color definitions for the floor and ceiling.
  - The 2D layout of the game map, where different characters represent walls, empty spaces, and sometimes other elements.

## Minimal Graphics Library

- **Use of a Minimal Graphics Library:**  
  Cub3D commonly utilizes **MiniLibX**—a lightweight graphics library—to handle:
  - Window creation
  - Image manipulation
  - User input (e.g., keyboard events for movement and rotation)

## Learning Objectives

- **Computer Graphics Fundamentals:**  
  Understand how 2D maps are transformed into a 3D visual representation.
- **Low-Level Programming:**  
  Gain experience in C programming, memory management, and interacting with a minimal graphics API.
- **Game Engine Basics:**  
  Learn about rendering loops, handling user input, and managing game state.

In summary, the Cub3D project is a hands-on exercise that introduces you to the basics of 3D graphics programming and game development by building a simple, yet functional, 3D engine from scratch.
